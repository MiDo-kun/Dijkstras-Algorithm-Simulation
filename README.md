# Dijkstra's Algorithm Simulation

## Project Overview

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a web application that uses p5.js, a JavaScript framework library, to simulate how Dijkstra's algorithm works. The project allows visitors to understand how the algorithm works in real-time by animating the entire process of the algorithm. This project aims to help fellow developers gain a better understanding of how the algorithm works in real-world scenarios.

The application is designed to be user-friendly and interactive. Users can define the speed of the algorithm and animate the algorithm according to their preferences, such as finding the shortest path or the shortest path tree.

## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Implement Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Use HTML canvas to display the graph.
- Use event loop APIs such as setInterval and setTimeout to handle multiple tasks simultaneously and animate the algorithm's progression.
- Use p5.js to draw nodes and edges in the canvas.
- Understand how graph theory works, its general components and how they correlate to solve real-world problems.

## Key Features

The Dijkstra's Algorithm Simulation offers the following key features:

- Animated progression of the algorithm.
- Use of weighted adjacency matrix.
- Find the shortest path between two nodes.
- Show the shortest path tree of the graph.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained the following knowledge and skills:

- A strong understanding of how event loops work in periodic updates and animation.
- How to draw objects in p5.js.
- How Dijkstra's algorithm works.
- How to use HTML canvas to display graphs.
- How to create custom graphs by using Weighted Adjacency Matrix.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in modern web development by using third-party libraries in JavaScript and related technologies. The skills and knowledge I gained will be useful in future web development projects.
